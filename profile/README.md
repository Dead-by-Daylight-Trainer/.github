## 🧭 Overview

This trainer functions as a modular enhancement suite: overlays, trackers, rhythm cues, and configurable reactions that flow with the heartbeat of a trial. It shows only what you choose to see, shaping tension into understanding—soft highlights tracing objectives, silhouettes shimmering with motion hints, and optional timing helpers that align with your own natural tempo.

Before you wander deeper, badges await, then features, compatibility tables, a setup path, a living diagram, and a fresh FAQ drawn from the whispers of the Entity’s realm.

## 🎯 Features

A constellation of modules, each tuned for clarity and subtle advantage:

* **Objective Vision**
  Soft glows encircle generators, totems, lockers, and exits—never overwhelming, always informative.

* **Character Silhouette Tracking**
  Survivors or killers shimmer with distance-scaled contours, remaining understated yet unmistakable.

* **Timing Assist Rhythm**
  A gentle visual pulse to help steady your skill checks without intruding on the music of the match.

* **Soundfield Awareness**
  Optional indicators for directional noises—footsteps, repairs, terror radius shifts—translated as light ripples.

* **Loadout Config Presets**
  Swap instantly between *Stealth*, *Chase*, *Support*, or handmade profiles with a single hotkey.

[!IMPORTANT]
Over-layering too many visuals may disrupt immersion. Enable only what enriches your personal playstyle.

## ⚡ Setup & Configuration

To guide your steps between shadow and light:

1. **Download** the latest trainer build.
2. Extract contents into a separate directory.
3. Run the launcher with admin rights to initialize modules.
4. Open your configuration panel and begin with something gentle:

   ```ini
   [stealth]
   obj_radius = 120
   silhouette_alpha = 0.45
   sound_ripple = true
   skillcheck_hint = minimal
   ```
5. Use the overlay menu (`F7` default) to fine-tune brightness, radius, and timing sensitivity.

[!NOTE]
Players on older GPUs may enable “Lite Mode” for smoother frame pacing.
